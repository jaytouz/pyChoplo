PyChoplo was design during my master degree in the gait lab of Laurent Ballaz. 

The data are generated by a Kinect and a Wii Balance Board integrated in a simple active video game. 
Different version of the game were made with differences in the output data structure which made it hard
to maintain a simple script. Therefore, I created this package that act as the pipeline to a common data structure to all version.
